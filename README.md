# Library Data for Visualizations

## Intro

The Library at Brock University generates a lot of data. Some of that data can be found in this repository. Everything is in csv files and are hopefully easy to understand. There is some template code for generating basic visualizations using [D3](https://d3js.org/)

## Data Files

_students_in_sessions_2017.csv_

Data is in two columns, date and number of students that were in a session.

[students_in_sessions_eg1.html](students_in_sessions_eg1.html)
Uses D3 to create gitHub style calendar of students seen per day




## Conclusion

Please clone this repository and generate your own interesting and unique visualizations.
